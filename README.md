## Overview

Welcome to the AgriTech Crop Suggestions System! This project provides an intelligent crop suggestion system and fertilizer recommendation based on input parameters such as soil nutrients, pH, rainfall, and location. Follow the steps below to set up and utilize the system effectively.

## üöÄ Setup

1. Download all the necessary libraries (Pandas, Numpy, sklearn, pickle, Flask).
2. Upload the entire `Crop_suggestion_system` folder into your preferred IDE, such as PyCharm (which we used).
   - **Note:** Upload the entire folder as it includes dataset folders and images for creating web pages.
3. Check for any errors related to package installations. If any, install the necessary libraries to resolve errors.
